## Features

The Food Order App project has several features, including:

1. Firebase Integration: The app uses Firebase to store meals. This allows for efficient retrieval and management of meal data.

2. Loading Spinner: When fetching meals from the database, the app displays a loading spinner. This provides visual feedback to the user, indicating that the app is processing the request.

3. Input Validation: The checkout popup in the app checks the input for validation. This ensures that users enter valid information when placing an order, reducing errors and improving the overall user experience.

5. Cart Functionality: Users can add meals to their cart and make modifications, such as adjusting quantities or removing items. The app calculates the total order amount and provides a summary of the selected items.

6. Order Placement: Once users have reviewed their order, they can place it through the app. The order is then stored in the database for further processing.
